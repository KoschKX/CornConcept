He came from old Seville
A man who if you met him
You would say he's alright
They call him Conquistador
He is the best with the corn,
And if you are in need he's probably tired.

[fades in to game]

He traveled to the new world
To bring his uncle back to life

Over the seas he went
Companions he freed no longer slaves,
were grateful.

Each with his own cross to bear,
Their destinies shared.
Yes, you might say they seem like okay guys.
